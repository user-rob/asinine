Who knows what empty headed stuff will end up here!

About me: I am mostly boring but quite good at cooking, rowing and being annoying. Also good at what I do - but that does not mean much considering the wide world of tech. Personal obsessions are keeping fit and general survival; running, cycling, rowing, hashing.
